My first neural network. There is no libraries, incredible architectures, gpu accelerating, or something that you can use, 
except if you are a learner. Simple network. It just works.

Learning method: Backpropagation

Activation function: Sigmoid

Bias neurons: supported

Error method: MSE

In 'deprecated' package you can find an old version of the network based on array. As you already thought it was a bad idea. 
I recommend that you delete this folder before using. There is no active usages.
